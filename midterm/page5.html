<h1>Page 1</h1>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Line 1:</strong> There was not a starting tag so I added the correct code.</li>
    <li><strong>Line 2:</strong> There was no html tag so I added one.</li>
    <li><strong>Line 75:</strong> The paragraph code was not closed correctly so I added the correct element code.</li>
    <li><strong>Line 81:</strong> The tag that was after 'fraiche' was not completed so I added one.</li>

<h1>Page 2</h1>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Line 27:</strong> Missing tag so I changed the beehive text to be completely bold.</li>
    <li><strong>Line 41:</strong> The link was broken so I changed the link to be fixed.</li>
    <li><strong>Line 53:</strong> Since the original element structure was no allowed I changed 'b' to be moved within 'h2'.</li>
    <li><strong>Page 57:</strong> The href location was broken so I replaced it with the correct wikipedia link.</li>
    <li><strong>Overall:</strong> The smaller headings were not matching one another so I made them equal.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Page 3</h1>

    <li><strong>Line 53:</strong> The element was getting an error due to childing issues so I switched it to a bullet point.</li>
    <li><strong>Line 63:</strong> The text did not accurately match what the table actually displayed so I changed it to say the correct amount of rows and columns.</li>

    <li><strong>Line 82:</strong> I closed the open tag.</li>
    <li><strong>Line 93:</strong> The code caused the columns to overflows so I moved it into the previous info.</li>
    <li><strong>Line 98:</strong> I relocated this to the last table value.</li>
</ul>
